<h1>Weeklist - 3420 Final Project</h1>

Weeklist was the cumulative effort of myself and my friend Jax Sutton over the course of a week and it served as our submission for our final project for Web Applications Development, a course we had taken during the summer after our first year of university. While the site is somewhat lacking on the design side, as it was one of our earliest web apps, it is a completely functional webapp with a login system that communicates with an SQL database and stores user data as well as tracking session data. This was our first real attempt at a full-scale webdev project.

Weeklist allows users to create and share their own unique wish list, importing links from any site of their choosing, even allowing them the ability to upload a custom thumbnail photo and name your products. It is, in short, a fully customizable web wish list.
